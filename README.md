# CS50 Projects

Each branch contains a different project. The first few are extremely simple and are intended to give an introduction to coding. 
There are two notable projects:

# Finance

In this project, a website is created using the Flask package in Python to create websites using Jinja. The website allows
users to create a profile to buy and sell stocks. 

# Speller

In this project, a spell checker is created by importing a dictionary into a trie, then checking a document against the trie.
